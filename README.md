# Quantitative-Calcium-Imaging

Custom code used for the analysis of quantitative calcium imaging is stored here.
These scripts were used for the publication on the development of Tq-Ca-FLITS.

## subfolders
### FLIM ImageJ Package
The folder 'FLIM_ImageJ_package' contains all ImageJ scripts created by Dorus Gadella, to convert lifetime stacks to lifetime images (Convert_flim-I-to-ij_v2.ijm and Convert_flim-II-to-ij.ijm) and to convert these lifetime images into a multipanel display (Lifetimes14.ijm and Lifetimes15.ijm). All other files in this folder are required for these scripts to function properly.

### R scripts for modelling
These scripts were used to determine the calcium sensitivity of Tq-Ca-FLITS and its pH sensitivity.
The CSV files contain the raw measurements needed.
